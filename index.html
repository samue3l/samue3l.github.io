    <h2> Program & Courses </h2>
    <p> I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Commerce degree in Business Technology Management at Toronto Metropolitan University. The program combines both business and tech., 
        seeing the increasing importance of technology in shaping business strategies and operations. 
        TMU's focus on real-world applications, like project management and data analysis, promised to equip me with practical skills that are highly valued in the job market. The opportunity to learn both business management and technological innovation in one program was a major factor, along with TMUâ€™s reputation for industry connections and internships, which I believed would help me kickstart my career.</p>
    <h3> Useful Course(s) </h3>
    <p><strong> ITM 500</strong> - This course introduces me to the core concepts in the data and information management.

and verifying its structural characteristics with normalization techniques.</p>
