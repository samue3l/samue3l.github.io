            <p>Hi, I’m Samuel Oni, and welcome to my portfolio!

                I’m a 4th year university student at T.M.U  currently pursuing a major in Business Technology Management. My passion for solving complex problems, organizing ideas, and working with people naturally led me to this field. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology and teamwork come together to achieve big goals. My dream is to become a project manager, where I can use my skills in strategic planning and leadership to guide projects from start to finish, creating meaningful and innovative solutions along the way.<br>
                
                <br>Outside of academics, sports are a big part of who I am. I’ve been playing representative volleyball since high school, and it’s been more than just a sport for me—it’s a life teacher. Volleyball has shown me the value of working as a team, staying dedicated to the grind, and staying calm under pressure. Whether it’s an intense game or an everyday challenge, these lessons stick with me and help me grow as a person.<br>
                
               <br>When I’m not on the volleyball court or hitting the books, you’ll likely find me watching basketball. I’m a huge Toronto Raptors fan, and Pascal Siakam is my favorite player. What I love about Siakam is his journey and how he worked his way up and keeps improving every day. His determination, versatility, and drive inspire me to keep pushing my own limits, no matter what I’m doing.<br>
                
                <br>But life isn’t all about work and competition, I also love spending quality time with the people who matter most to me. Some of my favorite memories are simple yet unforgettable: sitting around a campfire with friends, roasting marshmallows, laughing, and sharing stories under the stars. Moments like these remind me that it’s important to find balance, stay connected, and appreciate the little joys that life offers.</p>
