            <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Meta Descriptions:</strong> Meta descriptions are concise summaries of a webpage's content that appear in search engine results pages (SERPs) beneath the page title. These descriptions provide users with a clear and compelling reason to visit the site. Optimized meta descriptions, which include relevant keywords, can improve click-through rates by making the webpage more appealing to search engines and users (SitePoint, n.d.).<bold>This technique was implemented in the <code>&lt;head> </code>section of the website. </bold></p>
            <p><strong>HTML and CSS Validation:</strong> Validation of HTML and CSS code ensures that the webpage is free of errors and follows best practices. While search engines do not require valid code, clean and well-structured code makes it easier for search engine robots to crawl and index a webpage. Tools like the W3C HTML Validator and CSS Validator help identify and fix coding issues, improving the technical SEO and potentially boosting rankings (SitePoint, n.d.).</p>
            <p><strong>Heading Tags:</strong> Heading tags, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, organize webpage content into a clear hierarchy. These tags help search engines understand the structure and importance of the information on the page. Including relevant keywords in headings improves a page’s relevance to search queries and enhances its visibility in search results. Additionally, well-organized headings improve readability for users and search engine robots (Bruce Clay, n.d.).</p>

            <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Social Sharing Buttons:</strong> Adding social sharing buttons, like an "Instagram Like" button, encourages users to share content on their social media platforms. This increases a website's visibility and drives more traffic. As content is shared widely, it can also generate backlinks, indirectly benefiting SEO by improving the site’s authority (Liz Lockard, n.d.).</p>
            <p><strong>Engaging and Shareable Content:</strong> Creating high-quality, shareable content is a core SMO strategy. Content that resonates with an audience, such as visually appealing images or videos, is more likely to be shared on social platforms. Increased sharing drives traffic to the website and enhances its reach. Shareable content can also improve a site's social media presence and brand awareness (Rohit Bhargava, 2010).</p>
            <p><strong>Optimized Social Media Profiles:</strong> Well-optimized social media profiles with consistent branding and accurate, updated information help a website gain visibility in social media searches. Linking these profiles back to the website and using relevant keywords in the descriptions increases trust, improves SEO, and attracts a loyal audience. Consistent branding across platforms enhances the website’s credibility and engagement (Rohit Bhargava, 2010).</p>
